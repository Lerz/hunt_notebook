### **1. Executive Summary**
**Objective**: This threat hunt investigates the **August 2021 cyberattack on the Port of Houston** and explores whether similar vulnerabilities exist within your maritime operations. 

**Key Findings**:
- The **Port of Houston** attack exploited weaknesses in **password management systems** and highlighted risks to **OT systems** that manage critical maritime and port operations.
- Maritime companies with similar infrastructure face an increased risk of cyberattacks targeting outdated systems or weak network segmentation.

**Recommendations**:
- Accelerate **OT infrastructure assessments** across **ports and warehouses** to identify vulnerabilities.
- Integrate maritime depot, port warehouse and facilities into your **SOC** for centralized visibility, continuous monitoring, and faster incident response.

### **2. Scope & Methodology**
**Timeframe**: Focused on the August 2021 cyber incident at the Port of Houston and its implications for other maritime companies.  
**Data Sources**: Maritime cybersecurity threat intelligence, reports from **CISA** and industry sources detailing the Port of Houston attack, and related industry vulnerabilities.

### **3. Hypotheses/Queries**
- Are you vulnerable to similar attacks through **OT systems** at ports and warehouses?
- How can **SOC integration** improve your visibility and response to OT threats?

### **4. Findings**
**Techniques Detected**:
- The attackers exploited **password management vulnerabilities** within the Port of Houstonâ€™s **single-sign-on systems**, similar to what might be found in other **legacy OT infrastructures**.
- **Outdated OT systems**, including cargo handling systems, were at risk of further exploitation if network segmentation had not been properly implemented.

**Indicators of compromise (IOCs)**:
- **Unauthorized access attempts** into OT network segments that control logistical operations.
- **Phishing campaigns** aimed at obtaining access to maritime-related systems via administrative staff.

### **5. Mitigation & Response**
**Actions taken**:
- The Port of Houston was able to contain the attack through quick detection and network isolation, limiting the scope of the breach, we must conduce tabletop simulation and assure policies are updated.

### **6. Accelerating OT assessments and SOC integration**
Given the growing reliance on OT systems in maritime and port operations, it is essential to:
1. **Conduct OT assessments**: Perform detailed cybersecurity assessments of all OT systems in use at your port facilities and warehouses. This includes:
   - **Identifying outdated systems** that may not be patched regularly or integrated into the overall security framework.
   - Ensuring **network segmentation** between OT and IT environments to minimize the risk of lateral movement in the event of a breach.

2. **SOC integration for OT**:
   - **Visibility**: Integrate **OT systems** into your **SOC** to gain centralized visibility over both IT and OT environments. OT security threats can often go undetected if they are not actively monitored within the SOC.
   - **Incident Response**: A SOC that monitors OT networks will allow for faster response times in case of intrusions or anomalies, ensuring that operational disruptions are minimized.
   - **Automation and Monitoring**: Implement **real-time monitoring** and **alerting** for OT systems using automated tools to detect unusual behavior (e.g., unauthorized remote access attempts, malware propagation) in critical OT networks.

3. **Security Training**: Include **OT personnel** in cybersecurity training, focusing on phishing awareness, secure remote access, and the basics of securing connected OT devices.

**Further Recommendations**:
- Upgrade **legacy systems** and ensure that **remote access** to OT infrastructure is secured with strong authentication and encryption protocols.
- Regularly conduct **tabletop exercises** that simulate cyber incidents targeting OT systems, improving response times and preparedness across both IT and OT environments with all local IT.
